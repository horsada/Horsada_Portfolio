            <p>Motivation is tightly woven with the neurochemistry of movement. 
            The fundamental, recurring premise behind the science of 
            motivation and movement is dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for wanting
        and craving; it is released in anticipation of something we want, and it 
    dictates our desire to exert effort to achieve the thing we want. The main tool
    discussed to take advantage of the effects of dopamine to increase motivation
     is "dopamine scheduling".

    <h2>Detail</h2>
    <h4>Dopamine & Motivation</h4>
        <div class="fakeimg">
            <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
            src="assets/img/blog/motivation/Motivation_Dopamine.jpg" />
            <p>Dopamine is by far the biggest idea behind motivation in the podcast, and as such
            will have the biggest section devoted to it.
            </p>
            We often analyse dopamine in the context of the reward pathway. 
            The reward pathway begins at the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) 
            which contains neurons that release dopamine. From this, the brain 
            learns to associate a particular event with pleasure, resulting in the effect
            of the person wanting to do repeat that thing. However, the prefontal
            cortex is a part of the brain which acts as a break on the reward pathway, 
            otherwise humans would simply be a pleasure-seeking species.

    <h4>Serotonin</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/motivation/Motivation_Serotonin.PNG" />
        <p>Serotonin is often described as the "here and now" hormone due to the contentment
        effects it has. It causes us to focus on what we already have, as opposed to dopamine
        which focuses on what we don't have. The area of the brain called raphe is responsible
        for the release of serotonin. The optimal individual seeks to balance serotonin 
        and dopamine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Procrastination</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/motivation/Motivation_Procrastination.jpg" />
        <p>Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing a task. It is often the
        first hurdle someone must overcome to reach their goals and thus is an important 
        aspect of motivation. Procrastinators can be somewhat grouped into 2 areas: those 
        that relish the adrenaline and stress that comes from an impending deadline and those 
        that simply do not produce enough dopamine. 
        </p>
        <p>The first group could benefit from the following tools: super-oxygenation breathing, caffeine and/or L-Tyrosine. 
        Super-oxygenated breathing can trigger a massive release of adrenaline. Similarly, 
        ingesting caffeine causes a release in dopamine, the precursor to adrenaline. Finally,
        L-tyrosine is an amino-acid precursor to L-DOPA, which itself is a precursor to dopamine.
        The second group could benefit from consuming the bean Mucuna pruriens due to its high L-DOPA
        content and/or antidepressants as they are an enabler for the release of dopamine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Prolactin</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/motivation/prolactin.jpg" />
        <p>Prolactin is a hormone that is often produced after a major event, for example
        graduation or sexual orgasm. It arises somewhat inversely to dopamine. Taking the sexual 
        reproduction example, dopamine is release on anticipation and consumption of sex, 
        whereas prolactin is released after orgasm. 
        </p>
        <p>Prolactin is associated with lethargy and stillness
        and is the main driver behind the "refractory period" of males, which is the time taken that a
        male cannot gain an erection or ejaculate again. The refactory period decreases when
        a novel mating partner is introduced, a result of the novelty effect on dopamine release.
        </p>
        <p>A person can take prolactin inhibitors to diminish these levels of lethargy, namely Vitamin B6 
        and/or zinc.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Movement</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/motivation/Motivation_Movement.jpg" />
        <p>Dopamine inherently makes us anti-lazy. This was observed in a study on rats, where
        Group A of rats had unchanged brains, and Group B of rats had dopamine-depleted brains.
        Group B wouldn't move 1 rat length to receive food, despite still achieving pleasure 
        from the consumption of food. This shows that Group B's desire for movement was significantly 
        reduced as a result of the lack of dopamine.
        </p> 
        <p>Some tools that can act as nervous system stimulants are Beta-Phenylethylamine 
        (PEA) and Acetyl-L-carnitine. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Dopamine Scheduling</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/motivation/Motivation_Dopamine_Scheduling.jpg" />
        <p>Dopamine scheduling is a technique that aims to leverage the effects of dopamine on
        motivation towards achieving and sustaining goals. The key principle behind dopamine 
        scheduling is that dopamine is very subjective. This has been shown in various studies 
        and is closely related to the idea of growth mindsets. The central idea, known as
        intermittent reinforcement scheduling, is seen in gambling. It is one of the most
        powerful ways to keep someone doing something as it plays with the hope and anticipation
        of receiving a reward.
        </p>
        <p>To put the technique in a single, actionable phrase: "enjoy your wins,
        but not all of them." This helps to fight 2 problems associated with dopamien release: 1. The 
        subsequent "crash" after a release in dopamine and 2. The diminishing release of dopamine from
        continued rewards. It is essential to enjoy the wins at random.

        <p>Hosted by Dr. Andrew Huberman, The Huberman Lab Podcast discusses science 
        and science-based tools for everyday life. On this episode, the idea of motivation
        and drive is discussed, and in particular tools to increase motivation and drive
        to achieve and sustain goals.
