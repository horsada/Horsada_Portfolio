# Horsada_Portfolio
Adam Horsler Projects 
Portfolio Projects are ordered by date.

# Project 1: [C -> MIPS assembly Compiler](https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2020-cw-Morningism)
- Implemented using Flex/Yacc for lexing and parsing, then traversing the AST is done using C++.
- Input = C-- file, Output = MIPS assembly.

# Project 2: [FPGA-based Ping Pong game](https://github.com/horsada/InfoProcessing2020)
- FPGA hardware and software programming done using Quartus Prime and Eclipse.
- Intel DE-10 Lite FPGA with accelerometer for interacting with the game.
- Use C for high level synthesis
- Game implemented in Python.
- AWS Server to communicate between 2 players.

# Project 3: [MIPS CPU](https://github.com/horsada/MIPS_CPU)
- Implemented in SystemVerilog.
- Non-pipelined 3 cycle CPU based off the MIPS 1 ISA.
- Harvard-based architecture.

# Project 4: [Circuit Simulator](https://github.com/horsada/Circuit_Simulator)
- Implemented in C++.
- Similar to LTSpice.
- Converts a netlist of passive components (resistors, capacitors and cnductors) and 
voltage and current sources into graphical representations of voltage/current of each
component over time. 
- Graphs are done using MATLAB.
