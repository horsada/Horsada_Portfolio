            <p>Motivation is tightly woven with the neurochemistry of movement. 
            The fundamental, recurring premise behind the science of 
            motivation and movement is dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for wanting
            and craving; it is released in anticipation of something we want, and it 
            dictates our desire to exert effort to achieve the thing we want. The main tool
            discussed to take advantage of the effects of dopamine to increase motivation
            is "dopamine scheduling".

            <p>Record the time you wake up everyday. This time is important for deriving the 
                temperature minimum, which is the point in the 24 hour cycle where the body's 
                temperature is its' lowest. The temperature minimum is ~2 hours before waking up. 
                We will come back to why someone's temperature minimum is worth knowing.
            </p>
            <p>One of the first and perhaps most important things to do after waking up is getting into
                forward ambulation, which basically means moving forward. The effect of this is to 
                generate optic flow, which is the motion of objects relative to our eyes. Optic flow in the morning
                quiets the anxiety-releasing activity in a part of the brain called the amygdala as well as 
                increasing levels of alertness.
            </p>
            <p>Another important tool is getting sunlight in the morning. Thus, we can combine optic flow with 
                being outside, i.e. an outdoor walk. The morning sunlight has many positive effects and is perhaps the
                most important tool shared in this podcast. For example, the body will induce a natural pulse in cortisol
                from sunlight, promoting wakefulness, a healthy immune system etc. The suggest length of time to be in
                sunlight depends on its' levels, so something from 2 minutes to 30 minutes is advised.
            </p>
            <p>Blue blockers are not recommended in general, for a variety of reasons. Firstly, they block specific 
                wavelengths of light from reaching the eyes, which is not natural. Secondly, if the environment around
                you is still bright, they won't work as intended. In general, it is simply much better to be in a dim-light
                environment, and to only use blue blockers in the late evening when there is no alternative to viewing
                blue light.
            </p>
            <p>We are often dehydrated after sleep. It is therefore important to consume water after waking. A recommended 
                amount is 500ml-1l. For an added boost, we can add ions: sodium, magnesium and/or potassium to the water 
                as neurons require ionic flow to function properly. Adenosine is a chemical associated with sleepyness, 
                whereas caffeine is associated with alertness. Adenosine's levels in our body increase the longer we are awake. 
                We therefore have a low level of adenosine after waking,
                and as such want to delay any caffeine intake until 90-120 minutes after waking. This is because caffeine is a 
                competitive antagonist to adenosine, and having it too early will make us more susceptible to the sleepy 
                effets of adenosine in the afternoon, leading to what many experience as a mid-afternoon crash. The idea is
                therefore to keep a consistent level of alterness throughout the day. A suggest caffeine drink is Yerba Mate,
                because in addition to the caffeine it is shown to increase the release of GLP-1, which is directly related
                to glucagon - increasing the burning of fat.

        <p>Serotonin is often described as the "here and now" hormone due to the contentment
        effects it has. It causes us to focus on what we already have, as opposed to dopamine
        which focuses on what we don't have. The area of the brain called raphe is responsible
        for the release of serotonin. The optimal individual seeks to balance serotonin 
        and dopamine.

        <p>Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing a task. It is often the
        first hurdle someone must overcome to reach their goals and thus is an important 
        aspect of motivation. Procrastinators can be somewhat grouped into 2 areas: those 
        that relish the adrenaline and stress that comes from an impending deadline and those 
        that simply do not produce enough dopamine. 
        </p>
        <p>The first group could benefit from the following tools: super-oxygenation breathing, caffeine and/or L-Tyrosine. 
        Super-oxygenated breathing can trigger a massive release of adrenaline. Similarly, 
        ingesting caffeine causes a release in dopamine, the precursor to adrenaline. Finally,
        L-tyrosine is an amino-acid precursor to L-DOPA, which itself is a precursor to dopamine.
        The second group could benefit from consuming the bean Mucuna pruriens due to its high L-DOPA
        content and/or antidepressants as they are an enabler for the release of dopamine.

    <h4 class="page-title white-text teal">Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)</h4>

        <p>Prolactin is a hormone that is often produced after a major event, for example
        graduation or sexual orgasm. It arises somewhat inversely to dopamine. Taking the sexual 
        reproduction example, dopamine is release on anticipation and consumption of sex, 
        whereas prolactin is released after orgasm. 
        </p>
        <p>Prolactin is associated with lethargy and stillness
        and is the main driver behind the "refractory period" of males, which is the time taken that a
        male cannot gain an erection or ejaculate again. The refactory period decreases when
        a novel mating partner is introduced, a result of the novelty effect on dopamine release.
        </p>
        <p>A person can take prolactin inhibitors to diminish these levels of lethargy, namely Vitamin B6 
        and/or zinc.

        <p>Dopamine inherently makes us anti-lazy. This was observed in a study on rats, where
        Group A of rats had unchanged brains, and Group B of rats had dopamine-depleted brains.
        Group B wouldn't move 1 rat length to receive food, despite still achieving pleasure 
        from the consumption of food. This shows that Group B's desire for movement was significantly 
        reduced as a result of the lack of dopamine.
        </p> 
        <p>Some tools that can act as nervous system stimulants are Beta-Phenylethylamine 
        (PEA) and Acetyl-L-carnitine.
