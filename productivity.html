            <p>Motivation is tightly woven with the neurochemistry of movement. 
            The fundamental, recurring premise behind the science of 
            motivation and movement is dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for wanting
            and craving; it is released in anticipation of something we want, and it 
            dictates our desire to exert effort to achieve the thing we want. The main tool
            discussed to take advantage of the effects of dopamine to increase motivation
            is "dopamine scheduling".

    <h4 class="page-title white-text teal">Morning/Early Afternoon</h4>
        <div class="fakeimg">
            <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
            src="assets/img/blog/productivity/Productivity_Morning_2.PNG" />
            <p>Record the time you wake up everyday. This time is important for deriving the 
                temperature minimum, which is the point in the 24 hour cycle where the body's 
                temperature is its' lowest. The temperature minimum is ~2 hours before waking up. 
                We will come back to why someone's temperature minimum is worth knowing.
            </p>
            <p>One of the first and perhaps most important things to do after waking up is getting into
                forward ambulation, which basically means moving forward. The effect of this is to 
                generate optic flow, which is the motion of objects relative to our eyes. Optic flow in the morning
                quiets the anxiety-releasing activity in a part of the brain called the amygdala as well as 
                increasing levels of alertness.
            </p>
            <p>Another important tool is getting sunlight in the morning. Thus, we can combine optic flow with 
                being outside, i.e. an outdoor walk. The morning sunlight has many positive effects and is perhaps the
                most important tool shared in this podcast. For example, the body will induce a natural pulse in cortisol
                from sunlight, promoting wakefulness, a healthy immune system etc. The suggest length of time to be in
                sunlight depends on its' levels, so something from 2 minutes to 30 minutes is advised.
            </p>
            <p>Blue blockers are not recommended in general, for a variety of reasons. Firstly, they block specific 
                wavelengths of light from reaching the eyes, which is not natural. Secondly, if the environment around
                you is still bright, they won't work as intended. In general, it is simply much better to be in a dim-light
                environment, and to only use blue blockers in the late evening when there is no alternative to viewing
                blue light.
            </p>
            <p>We are often dehydrated after sleep. It is therefore important to consume water after waking. A recommended 
                amount is 500ml-1l. For an added boost, we can add ions: sodium, magnesium and/or potassium to the water 
                as neurons require ionic flow to function properly. Adenosine is a chemical associated with sleepyness, 
                whereas caffeine is associated with alertness. Adenosine's levels in our body increase the longer we are awake. 
                We therefore have a low level of adenosine after waking,
                and as such want to delay any caffeine intake until 90-120 minutes after waking. This is because caffeine is a 
                competitive antagonist to adenosine, and having it too early will make us more susceptible to the sleepy 
                effets of adenosine in the afternoon, leading to what many experience as a mid-afternoon crash. The idea is
                therefore to keep a consistent level of alterness throughout the day. A suggest caffeine drink is Yerba Mate,
                because in addition to the caffeine it is shown to increase the release of GLP-1, which is directly related
                to glucagon - increasing the burning of fat. 
            </p>
            <p>We choose to drink water and caffeine to remain in a fasted state, in addition to the aforementioned reasons.
                A fasted state is one where your insulin levels are at a low/baseline level. You can typically enter this state
                3-4 hours after eating, depending on the meal. Thus, after sleeping you are almost always in a fasted state.
                Fasting through the morning results in a heightened but calm state of alertness as it increases the level of 
                adrenaline in the body. Obviously, to stay in a fasted state it is ideal that no food is consumed. The first meal
                to break the fast can be at any time, but is advisable to be between 12-16 hours.
            </p>
            <p>Moving onto the work aspect of the morning, an intense session of work is suggested around 4-6 hours
                after your tempeature minimum (mentioned in the first paragraph). This is the time frame where most 
                people can produce their "best" work. 90 minutes is suggested for the duration of this work session
                due to it's relation to the ultradian cycle. To further optimise the work session, low-level white noise
                can be played in the background, preferably from a speaker, as it has been shown to increase attention and
                cognitive performance through dopamine release. Finally, the obvious attention protocols apply to this
                session of work, for example no phone distraction.
            </p>
        </div>
    <h4 class="page-title white-text teal">Exercise</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/productivity/Productivity_Exercise.jpg" />
        <p>While exercise can in general be done at any point in the day, it was advisable to do it shortly before or 
            after the first meal. There are 2 general categories for the exercise: strength and hypertrophy, or 
            endurance training. They should both last approximately an hour, and together be done 5 times a week in total.
            A 3:2 training split is suggested, switching the ratio every few weeks. These numbers are suggested 
            because this seems to lead to optimal effects, both physically (building muscle, cardio-vascular health, etc.)
            and mentally (brain-derived neutrophic factor, increased blood flow, etc.). Overtraining can lead to things like
            excessive fatigure, excessive cortisol, etc. It is also seperately worth mentioning the anti-inflammatory 
            effects of exercise in both limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and promoting the production of 
            anti-inflammatory cytokines.
        </p>
        <p>Going into the workout structure, there can be parallels drawn between the 2 categories of exercise mentioned.
            It is suggested that 80% of strength training should not be "to failure", where "to failure" is define as not
            being able to do 1 more repetition of an exercise due to fatigue. The same can be said about endurance training,
            however "to failure" would be associated with the burning sensation associated with lactic acid buildup in the 
            muscles.
        </p>
        <p>Training fasted can amplify the effects of exercise, and in particular lead to greater levels of fat oxidation; helping
            in fat loss. On the other hand, performance may be hindered for low-fat individuals in a fasted state. For lunch,
            which if fasting is considered the first meal of the day, it is advised to have a low carb, high protein meal. 
            Low carbs at lunch are to avoid the lethargic sensation that can arise from high-carb meals, keeping alertness 
            high into the afternoon. Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle, especially given the suggested
            exercise routine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="page-title white-text teal">Supplements and Stimulants</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/productivity/Productivity_Nutrients.jpg" />
        <p>Ingesting water with electrolytes allows us to stay in a fasted state while providing vital neuron ionic 
            function. Throughout the day, refined sugars should be avoided due to their ability to disrupt metabolism
            and neurons in the gut. They also have the effect of making the body crave more of it, which can make it 
            harder to follow a balanced diet.
        </p>
        <p>While stimulants before/after exercise/work can facilitate motivation and performance, there are some which
            are advised and some which aren't. For example, the role of caffeine in the morning has already been discussed
            and consumption is advised. This is because caffeine seems to not only increase dopamine release, but allow
            other activities to exert greater dopamine release. Other stimulants may have unwanted
            side-effects, for example addiction, and thus should be taken scarcely. Alpha-GPC is a stiumlant that can
            be taken rarely as it supports the release of acetylcholine, which plays a vital role in the nervous system.
        </p>
        <p>The hormones testosterone and oestrogen play important roles in the body, for example it is throught 
            oestrogen is the main way the brain maintains longevity. Testosterone and oestrogen are manufactured 
            from cholesterol, and thus it is important to include this in the diet. In addition, things like
            ~400mg tonkat ali can increase levels of free testosterone, while fadogia agrestis can stimulate 
            testosterone release.
        </p>
        <p>There are a variety of supplements available to aid sleep, many of which are not
            recommened due to their specific side effects. For example, serotonin can aid sleep 
            and thus direct serotnin supplements are offered. However, they can disrupt 
            sleep architecture and are thus not recommended. In addition, melatonin supplementation
            while being excellent at putting you to sleep, struggle to keep you asleep and are
            often given in to high dosages. On the other hand, some supplements are recommended:
            300-400mg magnesium threonate and magnesium bisgylcinate can support sleep, neuron
            health and longevity, especially when combined with 50mg apigenin or 100-200mg theanine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="page-title white-text teal">Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/productivity/Productivity_NSDR.jpg" />
        <p>Non-Sleep Deep Rest is a set of protocols that are able to improve every aspect
            of life, and thus deserve a section dedicated to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>The common foundation that all the protocols share is the deliberate and directed
            shift in one's state towards deeper relaxation. There is a focus on the protocols
            involved in hypnosis, which is a trance-like state in which there is a hightened
            sence of focus and concentration. 
        </p>
        <p>Practically, one can use apps to aid them in doing NSDR, randing from 10 minutes+ 
            sessions to 1-2 minutes. There is no set quantity per day of doing NSDR, but they
            can be used as and when wanted; although the suggested minimum is once per day
            for around 10 minutes. For example, NSDR could be a useful remedy to being unable
            to fall back asleep in the middle of the night.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="page-title white-text teal">Late Afternoon/Evening</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/productivity/Productivity_Afternoon.PNG" />
        <p>Naps can be used as a tool to rejunivate and replenish energy in the 
            afternoon to allow for greater productivity into the early evening,
             especially if you had a poor night's sleep the night before.
             However, the general rule behind naps is that they must be at most 90 minutes,
            otherwise the risk of interfering with that night's sleep becomes too high.
             In addition, there are in general 2 types of people: those where naps do
             interfere with night's sleep and those where it does not. If you happen to be
             in the latter category, naps may be a routinely tool, otherwise they should
             be used sparingly and with good reason, as described in the last paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>The afternoon naturally lends itself to another 90 minute bout of work,
            where your productivity levels should still be high (although probably not as
            high as in the morning). The rules behind this bout of work follow the rules
            outlined in the Morning/Early Afternoon section.
        </p>
        <p>The dinner macro's should differ slightly from the lunch one described in the
            first section as dinner is intended to support rest and deep sleep. The best
            way to achieve this is through having starchy carbohydrates to increase 
            serotonin, a precursor to melatonin. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="page-title white-text teal">Night Sleep and Weekends</h4>
    <div class="fakeimg">
        <img alt="Motivation sign" style="height:200px;" 
        src="assets/img/blog/productivity/Productivity_Afternoon.PNG" />
        <p>A good night's sleep is another one of the few tools that can improve every aspect
            of life. Some tools to aid a good night's sleep are to keep the room very dark and
            cool. A dark room signals to the brain that it is time for sleep, relating back to
            the circadium rhythm and the effects on the brain can be viewed as the opposite to
            sunlight exposure described in the Morning/Early Afternoon section. A cool room gives
            the body the opportunity to cool itself while in sleep (i.e. unconsciously) by exposing
            a body part to outside the covers, reducing the likelihood of waking up as a result
            of being too hot/cold.
        </p>
        <p>Another potential cause of bad sleep is as a result of fighting sleepiness in the
            evening. This is essentially you battling the effects of melatonin in the body, 
            resulting in a lack of melatonin in the night. This means the morning cortisol
            spike discussed in the Morning/Early Afternoon section is shifted earlier, 
            potentially causing you to wake up in the middle of the night. Despite the obvious
            remedy of going to sleep when the body signals to (i.e. high melatonin), 
            we can employ the following tools to counter this problem: NSDR can be used as 
            discussed in the NSDR section, and/or viewing bright light in the evening to 
            offset melatonin release to later.
        </p>
        <p>The weekends are of course less rigid and thus many of the tools discussed in the
            podcast may not be followed for the weekend. However, there are 2 tools specifically
            mentioned that everyone should try and do 7 days a week. The first tool is to try and sleep on a regular basis and at regular times. The disruption
            from changing the sleeping rhythm on weekends on the body cannot be overstated. Secondly,
            morning sunlight is imperative to give enough information to your body so that it can
            correctly regulate the circadium rhythm, the fundamental notion that all the tools
            discussed previously are built on.
